# CoronaCurves
This is a repo to predict the Corona Curve for the state of TX from 7/7 to 8/7
The fully rendered notebook can be viewed here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andrewmejia600/CoronaCurves/blob/master/Corona_Curve_Forecast_Texas_Andrew_Mejia.ipynb
We take two states NY and NJ who had completed curves by 7/6 and use CA and FL as proxy curves to predict the Texas curve. 
There is a model using a neural net to predict daily new cases and a hidden Markov Model is used and ploted.
